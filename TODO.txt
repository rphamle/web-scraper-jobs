- rethink how to separate folders in build
- try beautifulsoup/scrapy
- parametrize/environment variables into local/dev/qa/... (like search keywords, chromedriver location, etc.)
- reduce disk space of Docker image
- set up kafka/rabbitmq
- set up database(s)
- set up airflow(?)
- genericize Docker build process for different scrapers
- handle multiple worker deploy
- push base worker image to Dockerhub
